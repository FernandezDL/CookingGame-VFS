# Cooking Game - VFS
Cooking Game for the Rapid Prototyping class at VFS

## Description
After a meeting with the client, Spencer, has asked us to create a prototype of a mobile Cooking Game that would allow him to win money. The game is based on daily recipies, micro transactions, adds, a live service model, and room to add more games each day.

The main mechanic of the game will be to cook and create a recipe based on a set of easy interactions and movements to allow the player to cook the simple recipes. Every day the player will be presented with 3 recipes to cook in order, each one representing the 3 meals of the day, Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner. Also, with the micro transactions the player can unlock 2 additional recipes to cook and gain more points.

## Gameplay
### Main Screen
The first screen of the game is the list of the 5 recipes, 3 available and 3 locked. From this scene the player can navigate to the `Store`, to buy better applpiances and win more points on each recipe, the `Leaderboard`, where the user can see the 5 players with the bests scores, and the game scene.

### Game Scene
In the main scene the player can select a recipe to cook and this will move them to the Game Scene, where the cooking start and the game will explain you how to cook with simple instructions. When the recipe is complete the score will show and you'll be allow to move to the `Share screen`.

### Share screen
This screen appears after the player has finished cooking. In here the player can return to the recipe list (in the actual game the recipe list would refresh and new recipes will be unlocked if possible) or share the recipe photo in their social media.

### Store Screen
Coming from the `Main Screen`, the player can buy a few appliances and upgrade their cooking materials and spices to get more and more point while cooking. In this sceen you can also return to the `Main Screen` with the arrow in the upper left corner.

### Leaderboard Screen
Comming from the `Main Screen`, the player can see the leaderboard of the game and the top 5 users with most points. The player can also return to the `Main Screen` with the arrow in the upper left corner.

## Run the prototype
To run the prototype download the code from the [GitHub](https://github.com/FernandezDL/CookingGame-VFS.git), open the Unity project and run it as a normal project.
